    coast_text_html: "Ideally located on the heights of the Basque coast, Coast welcomes you in a terracotta vibe.

    title_3: "About us"
    text_2_html: "Utopy is an adventure imagined by two childhood friends during their high school years. Our vision was to create an ideal place that brought together our shared passions: friends, adventure and travel. After graduating with degrees in tourism, we embarked on a quest for unique experiences around the world. This led us to discover, study and approve a particular type of accommodation: the hostel. A place for sharing, meeting new people and enjoying a good time, while remaining accessible to even the most modest budgets."
    text_2_2_html: "It was with our team, no bigger than the two of us, that we founded our company: 'Utopy Hostel'. And so tasted all the joys of entrepreneurship: business plans, town halls, banks, real estate agencies, partners. Then there was the work, leading us to take on the roles of painter, tiler, cabinetmaker, electrician and decorator, while juggling the responsibilities of accountant, communications manager and copywriter. But it's possible! It's been a journey as intense as it has been exciting, culminating in the realization of our dream: the creation of comfortable, user-friendly spaces, true to our initial vision. Utopia can sometimes become reality! Utopy Hostel opened its doors in March 2022. And it's thanks to you, our wonderful customers, that this adventure is so beautiful today. We look forward to many more years at your side!"
    title_3_2_html: "<strong>Why « Utopy » ?</strong>"
    text_2_3: "Utopy is a little stylization on our part of the word utopia, which means « ideal dream society » and comes from the Greek eu-topo meaning « good place ». Our logo is reminiscent of the Australian aboriginal symbol for « meeting place ». A nod to the country where our project was born."
